DESCRIPTION
_printf was created as a part of a project for Holberon School, we intend to replicate the usage of the printf() function in the <stdio.h> library.

FUNCTIONS
printf has built in a series of functions to secure it's performance.


fun_str - this function is called when the '%s' is used, it prompts for the string sent, and evaluates
character by character, making sure it prints the correct output.

fun_char - this function is called when the '%c' is used, it promts for the character sent, and prints
the correct output.

fun_int - this function is called when the '%i' is used, it prompts for the numbers sent, and evaluates
integer by integer, making sure it prints the correct output.

fun_d - this function is calle when the '%d' is used, this function has a similar response as fun_int,
except this function is called for base 10 integers.

OPTIONS
-%s to print  a string.

-%c to print a character.

-%i to print an integer.

-%d to print a base 10 integer.
